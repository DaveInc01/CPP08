# CPP MODULES

## Summary

This repository contains the modules of the C++ piscine from 42 School.

Each module is in a folder named `cppXX` where `XX` is the number of the module.

The higher the number, the more advanced the module is.

In all of these exercises, I have adhered to good coding practices, ensuring that my code is clean, readable, and efficient. All my code has been compiled using the `c++` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and it has been confirmed to compile with the `-std=c++98` flag as well.

## Module 08 - Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms

This module focused on Container Templates, Iterators, and Algorithms. In the project, I was introduced to container templates, iterators, and algorithms in C++.

These exercises helped me understand the different types of containers available in C++, such as sequence containers, associative containers, and derived containers, and their use cases. Additionally, I worked with iterators to manipulate and traverse through these containers, and used various algorithms to perform operations on the container data.

### Acquiered Skills

- Deep understanding of container templates, iterators, and algorithms in C++
- Proficiency in programming with C++98 standards
- Practical experience with different types of containers such as sequence containers (vector, deque, list, forward_list, array), associative containers (set, map, multiset, multimap), and derived containers (stack, queue, priority_queue)
- Strong ability to design and implement efficient data structures and algorithms in C++
- Experience in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code

### Exercises

The repository consists of the following exercises:

- **Exercise 00: Easy Find**
- **Exercise 01: Span**
- **Exercise 02: Mutant Stack**

Each exercise had specific instructions and requirements, pushing me to think critically about the best ways to use and manipulate containers in C++, and to solve problems in an efficient and effective manner.
